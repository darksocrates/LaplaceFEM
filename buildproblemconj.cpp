 NOTES
 
 This function utilizes the EIGEN C++ library to handle the sparse matrices.
 
 
 INPUTS
 
 nodes - nx3 vector<vector<int>> of element to node map -- passed by reference
 nodepoints - m x 2 vector<vector<double>> of node to x,y cordinate map -- passed by reference
 boundary nodes -  vecotr<int> of the nodes on the boundary -- passed by reference
 fun - a function corresponding to the dirichlet boundary data -- passed by function pointer
 
 
 OUTPUT
 
 A - The assembled stiffness matrix for the FEM for poissons with linear interpolation in CSR format. Contains only the the interior nodes.
 
 RHS - The assembled RHS for the FEM with enforced boundary conditions, contains only the interior nodes. The boundary nodes have been removed and had their boundary conditions enforced.
 
 BoundaryValue - VectorXd containing the weights forthe boundary nodes.
